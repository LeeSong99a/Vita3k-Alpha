# PS Vita Game ROM and BIOS:
Due to the limitations of the law, We will not provide any game ROM and BIOS images to players.

------
# Goals in the future:
After a year, on Snapdragon 450 devices (or Geekbench’s Android phones 4 single-core performance is greater than 1600), Vita3K can run 90% of all PS Vita games near full frame (60FPS+), and Vita3K can run 90% of all ps vita games close to perfect compatibility (No Bugs Display).

Therefore, The best combination of PS emulators on mobile devices is Vulkan emulator and Dolphin emulator. They are the Vita emulator and the GC emulator respectively. Note: The Vulkan emulator is only a PS Vita emulation, not a GC emulator. Vita3K does not integrate Dolphin emulators.

If you want to increase the game's frame rate to 20 ~ 60%, please remove "Thermal Engine" in android system.
